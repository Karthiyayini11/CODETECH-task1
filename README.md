TITLE:
•	Password Strength Checker

DESCRIPTION:
•	This is a Python script that allows you to check the strength of passwords.
•	It uses the library to evaluate the strength of passwords based on factors such as length, complexity, and common usage.

Features:-
•	Check the strength of a password.
•	Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

Requirements-
•	Python 3.x

Steps to Implement:
1.Define Strength Criteria:
   - We'll define a password as strong if it meets the following conditions:
     - Contains at least 8 characters
     - Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters
     - Has at least one digit
     - Contains at least one special character (like !, @, #, etc.)
2. Function Implementation:
   -Write a function that takes a password as input and checks these conditions.
   -Return a message indicating the strength level of the password.
3. Implementation in Python program
