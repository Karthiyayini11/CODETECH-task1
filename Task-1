//A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, and has at least one digit. 
You may need to test the string against multiple regex patterns to validate its strength.
Here's my code ...//

import re
regExLower=re.compile(r'[a-z]+')
regeExUpper=re.compile(r'[A-Z]+')
regExNum=re.compile(r'[0-9]+')
print('Enter a password to check it\'s strength')
test=str(input())
lower=regExLower.findall(test)
upper=regeExUpper.findall(test)
num=regExNum.findall(test)
if len(test)>=8 and lower!='' and upper!='' and num!='':
    print(test+' is a strong password')
else:
    print(test+' is not a strong password')
